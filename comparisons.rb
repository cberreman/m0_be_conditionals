# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result.

# One example is already completed. Your task is to complete
# any remaining prompt.

# Make sure to run the file in your command line. Look back

#-------------------
# PART 1: Comparing variables
#-------------------

number_teachers = 4
number_students = 20
string_teachers = "4"
numberDogs = 0

# EXAMPLE: print the result of the comparison: is number_seachers greater than number_students?
puts "Is number_teachers greater than number_students?", number_teachers > number_students
# this should print: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_teachers less than number_students?
puts "Is number_teachers less than number_students?", number_teachers < number_students
# this should print: true

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_teachers equal to string_teachers?
puts "Is number_teachers equal to string_teachers?", number_teachers == string_teachers
# this should print: false

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_teachers not equal to number_students?
puts "Is number_teachers not equal to number_students?", number_teachers != number_students
# this should print: true

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_students greater than or equal to 20?
puts "Is number_students greater than or equal to 20?", number_students >= 20
# this should print: true

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_students greater than or equal to 21?
puts "Is number_students greater than or equal to 21?", number_students >= 21
# this should print: false

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_students less than or equal to 20?
puts "Is number_students less than or equal to 20?", number_students <= 20
# this should print: true

# YOU DO: print the result of the comparison: is number_students less than or equal to 21?
puts "Is number_students less than or equal to 21?", number_students <= 21
# this should print: true


#-------------------
# PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
#-------------------

# For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a Comment,
# in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.
# Be as technically precise as possible, but don't just copy and paste a definition from the readings.
# Make sure YOU can explain it that way!

puts 4 < 9
#YOU DO: Explain. This code is evaluating whether 4 is less than 9 which will result in an output of TRUE.

books = 3
puts 4 < books
# YOU DO: Explain. This code is evaluating whether 4 is less than the variable "books". Since the variable "books" was assigned an integer value of 3,
# the output for this code would be false as 4 is not less than 3.

friends = 6
siblings = 2
puts friends > siblings
# YOU DO: Explain. This code is evaluating whether the variable "friends" is greater than the variable "siblings". Since the variable "friends" is assigned 
# an integer value of 6 and the variable "siblings" is assigned an integer value of 2, the output would be TRUE as 6 is greater than 2.

attendees = 9
meals = 8
puts attendees != meals
# YOU DO: Explain. This code is evaluating whether the variable "attendees" is not equal to the variable "meals". Since the variable "attendees" is assigned an
# integer value of 9 and the variable "meals" is assigned a integer value of 8, the output would be TRUE as 9 is not equal to 8.


#-------------------
# PART 3: Logical Operators
#-------------------

is_hungry = true
finished_homework = false

# EXAMPLE:
# Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
puts is_hungry && finished_homework
# Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
puts is_hungry || finished_homework

loves_to_play = true
loves_dog_park = false
loves_treats = true
age = 1

# YOU DO:
# Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
puts loves_to_play && loves_treats

# Determine if the dog loves to play and loves the dog park
puts loves_to_play && loves_dog_park

# Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
puts loves_to_play || loves_dog_park

# Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
# Assume that a dog is a puppy if it is less than 2 years old.
puts loves_to_play && age < 2
# What did your final line of code evaluate to? Why do you think that is? Explain.
# ANSWER: It evaluated to TRUE as both conditions were satisfied as TRUE that the dog loves to play and TRUE that the dog is less than 2 years old. Since the 
# both of these conditions were TRUE, determining the outcome of the AND statement would result in TRUE as well.
